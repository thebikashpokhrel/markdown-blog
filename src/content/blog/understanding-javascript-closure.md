JavaScript closures are a fundamental concept that allows functions to retain access to their lexical scope even when the function is executed outside of that scope. In this post, we will explore how closures work, provide examples, and discuss their use cases.

### What is a Closure?

A closure is created when a function is defined within another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function's variables.

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  let outerVariable = "I'm from the outer scope!";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  }

  return innerFunction;
}

const myFunction = outerFunction();
myFunction(); // Output: I'm from the outer scope!
```

### Conclusion

Closures are powerful tools in JavaScript that enable you to create private variables and encapsulate functionality.
